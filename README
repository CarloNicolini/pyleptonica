pyleptonica
===========

At this stage this is a very thin ctypes wrapper over the Leptonica
library. 
Almost all functions are exposed to Python, correctly anotated, and data
structures used in Leptonica are available as classes from Python. One an create and fill new structures, or read the values returned by any Leptonica function.

This Library is licensed under the Lesser GNU Public License Version 3 or Later.

It transposes Leptonica's extensive inline documentation to Python's docstrings, so it is possible to check for help and parameter types
from the Python interpreter, using pydoc or from an IDE. 

However, whenever a function takes pointers or arrays of pointers as 
parameters, these will have to be created by hand using ctypes
facilities before calling the functions. (Except for pointers
to Leptonica data structures: the Python wrappers will automatically
promote a Python Structure instance of the given structure into a pointer
before calling a C function. And they will de-reference pointer to
such structures so that function calls return a Structure instance,
not a pointer to a structure.

(Don't ask me how to free the memory for such structure afterwards --
I am into it, but I don't know for shure yet :-p )

This is on a very early stage. 

To run it, you might not need to have Leptonica source files:
I versioned the generated files as well so that most people jsut have
to copy the .py files around. If you want to hack the code, or generate 
wrappers for other versions of Leptonica, you have to execute
the leptonica_header_parser and leptonica_function_parser as stand
alone programs, afeter tunning a config.py from the config_Template.py
file

Also, although I have not tested this under windows or Mac OS-- it
probably need some tweaks to run (mostly finding the correct libraries 
with ctypes)

Have fun!
