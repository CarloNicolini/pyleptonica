This project aims to be a Python transparent wrapper for the Leptonica Library. (http://www.leptonica.com)

It uses ctypes, and, currently, some scripts to automatically wrap most leptonica functions into Python

It is currently in a very early stage and most functions require manually mangling with pointers and structures before being called.
